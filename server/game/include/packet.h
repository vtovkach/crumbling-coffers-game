/*
    Packet Header Layout (40 bytes)

    game_id (16 bytes):
        Unique identifier for the game session.
        Used to quickly filter out packets that do not belong to this session.

    player_id (16 bytes):
        Unique identifier for the sender (player).

    control (2 bytes):
        Bitfield for packet metadata and flags.
        bit 0:
            0 -> reliable packet (uses reliability layer)
            1 -> regular packet (no reliability guarantees)
        bit 1:
            0: -> established connection  
            1: -> init connection
        Remaining bits are reserved for future use.

    payload_size (2 bytes):
        Size of the payload in bytes (excluding header).

    seq_num (4 bytes):
        Sequence number used for ordering and duplicate detection.
