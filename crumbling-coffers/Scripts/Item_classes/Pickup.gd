# ### Variable descriptions/explanations ### 
# ItemType: used to define if the item is a collectible or an ability/consumable.
# ability: for consumable items - set their ability to bool and specify directly in "subclass" what it does 
	# if set to TRUE.
		# !! (Up for improvements. This is a basic implementation for now.) !!
# rarity: for collectibles. Common, rare, legendary status is assigned here.
# score: how much value the item is worth.
		# !! Going forth with the idea that ability/consumable items will have a score assigned to them 
		# and will contribute to the final score if not used. 
			# Not finalized design; up to changes in the future. !!
